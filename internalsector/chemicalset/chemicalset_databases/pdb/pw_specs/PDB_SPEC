Every PDB file may be broken into a number of lines terminated by an
end-of-line indicator.
  Each line in the PDB entry file consists of 80 columns.

 The PDB file may also be viewed as a collection of record types.
Each record type consists of one or more lines.

  Each record type is further divided into fields.


Single records
may only appear one time (without continuations) in a file.

RECORD TYPE       DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CRYST1            Unit cell parameters, space group, and Z.
END               Last record in the file.
HEADER            First line of the entry, contains PDB ID code,
                  classification, and date of deposition.
MASTER            Control record for bookkeeping.
ORIGXn            Transformation from orthogonal coordinates to the submitted
                  coordinates (n = 1, 2, or 3).
SCALEn            Transformation from orthogonal coordinates to fractional
                  crystallographic coordinates (n = 1, 2, or 3).


It is an error for a duplicate of any of these records to appear in an entry.

Single Continued records

There are records that conceptually exist only once in an entry, but the
information content may exceed the number of columns available. These records
are therefore continued on subsequent lines. Listed alphabetically, these are:

RECORD TYPE       DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTHOR            List of contributors.
CAVEAT            Severe error indicator.  Entries with this record must be
                  used with care.

SPRSDE            List of entries withdrawn from release and replaced by

The second and subsequent lines contain a continuation field which is a
right-justified integer. This number increments by one for each additional line
of the record, and is followed by a blank character.

Multiple records

Most record types appear multiple times, often in groups where the information
is not logically concatenated but is presented in the form of a list. Many of
these record types have a custom serialization that may be used not only to
order the records, but also to connect to other record types. Listed
alphabetically, these are:

Multiple Continued records

There are records that conceptually exist multiple times in an entry, but the
information content may exceed the number of columns available. These records
are therefore continued on subsequent lines. Listed alphabetically, these are:

RECORD TYPE       DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FORMUL            Chemical formula of non-standard groups.
HETATM            Atomic coordinate records for heterogens.
HETNAM            Compound name of the heterogens.

The second and subsequent lines contain a continuation field which is a
right-justified integer. This number increments by one for each additional line
of the record, and is followed by a blank character.

Grouping records

There are three record types used to group other records. Listed
alphabetically, these are:

RECORD TYPE       DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENDMDL            End-of-model record for multiple structures in a single
                  coordinate entry.

                  single coordinate entry.
TER               Chain terminator.

The MODEL/ENDMDL records surround groups of ATOM, HETATM, SIGATM, ANISOU,
SIGUIJ, and TER records. TER records indicate the end of a chain.

Other records

The remaining record types have a detailed inner structure. Listed
alphabetically, these are:

JRNL              Literature citation that defines the coordinate set.
REMARK            General remarks, some are structured and some are free form.

Note that a PDB file existing outside of the PDB official release may contain
locally-defined records beginning with "USER". The PDB reserves the right to
add new record types (not beginning with "USER"), so programs which read PDB
entries should be prepared to read (and ignore) other record types. PDB will
follow standard procedures whenever format changes are proposed.

The above information on Order of Records is repeated as Appendix 7.
Field Formats

Each record type is presented in a table which contains the division of the records into fields by column number, defined data type, field name or a quoted string which must appear in the field, and field definition. Any column not specified must be left blank.

Each field contains an identified data type which can be validated by a program. These are:

DATA TYPE          DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------
AChar              An alphabetic character (A-Z, a-z).
Atom               Atom name which follow the naming rules in Appendix 3.
Character          Any non-control character in the ASCII character set or a
                   space.
Continuation       A two-character field that is either blank (for the first
                   record of a set) or contains a two digit number
                   right-justified and blank-filled which counts continuation
                   records starting with 2.  The continuation number must be
                   followed by a blank.
Date               A 9 character string in the form dd-mmm-yy where DD is the
                   day of the month, zero-filled on the left (e.g., 04); MMM is
                   the common English 3-letter abbreviation of the month; and
                   YY is a year in the 20th century.  This must represent a
                   valid date.
IDcode             A PDB identification code which consists of 4 characters,
                   the first of which is a digit in the range 0 - 9; the
                   remaining 3 are alpha-numeric, and letters are upper case
                   only.  Entries with a 0 as the first character do not
                   contain coordinate data.
Integer            Right-justified blank-filled integer value.
Token              A sequence of non-space characters followed by a colon and a
                   space.
List               A String that is composed of text separated with commas.
LString            A literal string of characters.  All spacing is significant
                   and must be preserved.
LString(n)         An LString with exactly n characters.
Real(n,m)          Real (floating point) number in the FORTRAN format Fn.m.
Record name        The name of the record: 6 characters, left-justified and
                   blank-filled.
Residue name       One of the standard amino acid or nucleic acids, as listed
                   below, or the non-standard group designation as defined in
                   the HET dictionary.  Field is right-justified.
SList              A String that is composed of text separated with semi-colons.
Specification      A String composed of a token and its associated value
                   separated by a colon.
Specification      A sequence of Specifications, separated by semi-colons.
  list
String             A sequence of characters.  These characters may have
                   arbitrary spacing, but should be interpreted as directed
                   below.
String(n)          A String with exactly n characters.
SymOP              An integer field of from 4 to 6 digits, right-justified, of
                   the form nnnMMM where nnn is the symmetry operator number and
                   MMM is the translation vector.  See details in Appendix 1.


To interpret a String, concatenate the contents of all continued fields together, collapse all sequences of multiple blanks to a single blank, and remove any leading and trailing blanks. This permits very long strings to be properly reconstructed.

The above information about field formats is repeated as Appendix 6.

Residue Names

Standard residue names used in PDB entries:

RESIDUE TYPE       RESIDUE NAME
