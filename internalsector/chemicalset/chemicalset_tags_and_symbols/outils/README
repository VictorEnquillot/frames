a category 
  is either :

   a symbol   
   a marker 
   a path
   a formula 
   a value ?

an entity 
   always defines a module for any of its category

a module   
   the name for a module = entity_category

a constructor 
   the name of a constructor ( a type constructor) is either
   the name of a module  

   | Module of Module_abbreviation_category_abbreviation.module 
   | Module of Mac.module
  
  the name of a zero level constructor not being an entity.

   | Constructor

  the name of a basic type 

   | Bool of bool
   | Char of char
   | Int of int
   | Float of float
   | String of string

  the name of a data structure 

   | Mixed of (Mac.module, Mac.module) Dbt_t.doublet 
   | List of Mac.module list 
   | Tree of Mac.module Tre_t.tree 

a level for a constructor for an entity 
  is either 
    1 if it has a of 
    0 if it has not
   
an entity_constructor_set 

  is a list which contains all the names of the type constructors 
  for this entity.

  for energy : energy_kinetic energy_potential energy_total
  these may have different levels
     
  energy_kinetic has level 1
  energy_total   has level 0

a level for an entity 
  the level of an entity is one more than the highest levels of its constructors
  listed in module_constructor_set.

  energy has level 2 because energy_kinetic has level 1
