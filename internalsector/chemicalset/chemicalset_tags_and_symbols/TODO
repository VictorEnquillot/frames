1. use designator to transfer states

  (symbol + environment state) -> designator 

--------------------------------------------------

symbol / state -> symbol normalization

--------------------------------------------------
Block Symbols : if central atom is charged : Mendeleev+p    Mendeleev+m

  Nh      neutral (np p nor m)
  Nph     p : notes the + charge on on N
  Crmoo   r : notes the e- delocalization, m : notes the - charge on C (conjugation)


2. May be inverse subsymbol order in residue and peptideca:

  type residue_symbol =
   | Glycine_symbol of glycine_symbol	      
   | Proline_symbol of proline_symbol	      	      
   | Regular_symbol of regular_symbol	      

  and glycine_symbol = 
  | Embedded_glycine_symbol of embedded_glycine_symbol
  | Nterminal_glycine_symbol of nterminal_glycine_symbol 
    
  and proline_symbol = 
   | Embedded_proline_symbol of embedded_proline_symbol
   | Nterminal_proline_symbol of nterminal_proline_symbol 

  and regular_symbol = 
  | Embedded_regular_symbol of embedded_regular_symbol
  | Nterminal_regular_symbol of nterminal_regular_symbol


3. Revisiting Blocks.
   A block type must tell how many and what bonds are done ahead and backwards.
   Therefore collecting bonds is done from block list.  

4. All residue stuff needs simplifications.

5. Symbols are independently defined entities :
   - polypeptide_symbol and protein_symbol defined independently.
   - aminoacid, residue, sidechain should be.

6. is GLX an aminoacid or some PDB avatar ?

7. Sidechain_symbol is option aminoacid_regular_symbol ?

8. modify the "_" in c_ and h_ ...
