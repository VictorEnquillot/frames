    On a regroupé ci-dessous la liste des structures les plus répandues en fonction du nombre de coordination (NC) (ou coordinence) :

    * NC = 2 : linéaire,
    * NC = 3 : trigonale plane,
    * NC = 4 : tétraédrique ou plan carrée
    * NC = 5 : bipyramidale à base triangulaire ou pyramidale à base carrée
    * NC = 6 : octaédrique ou prisme trigonale
    * NC = 7 : bipyramidale à base pentagonale

(** In a molecule a [Block] is made of one 'core' atom 
    and zero or several 'onetied' or 'leaf' atoms exclusively bonded to it. 

    A Block is never closed (only Molecules are closed) as an element of
    the bonding system.

    - The nature of a Block is to be part of a fragment which is has 
      linear structure.

      In a fragment a block is bonded  zero or one times backwards
      A block is located 
      - at the head of a fragment
      - in the body of a fragment
      - at the tail of a fragment
      
      For convenience it is built according to these rules :

      1. The first part is the atom_symbol of the core atom.
      2. then follows the concatenation of the `leaf' atom_symbol
         the order ( if needed ) is F(orth), L(eft), U(p), R(ight), D(own).
      3. repeated atom_symbols are indicated by an integer (C_h_4, Oh2)

      4. the charge if any is indicated by 
          -- adding p to the atom symbol for cation Np (N+), Capp (Ca++)
          -- adding m to the atom symbol or block for anion Ccoc2 (Cdodo-)

      5. the conjugation is noted by adding r to the atom symbol

      6. to simplify Arp is noted As (Ns of Guanidinium)

      7. Sometimes it is necessary to tell how many ties a symbol makes :
         C makes 4 ties 
         Cd make 3 ties 
         Ct make two ties        

    - A Block Symbol caracterizes the chemical formula 
                                  and the bonding properties of the Block ??? 

     Nomenclature

     zero, one, fork mean no, one tie of whatever bond, one fork of any kind.

     onefork is one tie at left and a fork at right.

    When upgraded a Chemical a leaf (methyl -Ch3)
                  a Rchemical is a head  (rmethyl Ch3-)


    A known chemical entity is designed 
    - by its chemical name when Block_symbol
    - by its chemical name suffixed 
          by _h if it is a head  methyl_h
          by _l if it is a leaf  methyl_l
          by _c if it is closed  water_c 
    - by its chemical name prefixed
          by r_ if is a Block_symbol head (reversed)
