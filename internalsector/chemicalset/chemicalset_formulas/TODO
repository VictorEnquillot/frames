1. CrhNhCr is correct : CrhNrhCr is not  

2. Need to introduce the Geometrical state :

   a. Spin state
      H2C=CH2  is singlet
      H2Cr-CrH2 is triplet state (rotation by 90Â°)

      the same for O=C=O and O=Cr-O

   b. Chiral state
      L and D Ch state is induced by the Residue Chiral State L or D 
      This state defines the Fragment Index which is then Left or Right

      there must exist a function 

     val chiral : chiral_state -> fragment_index 
     inside  Fri_v.fragment_index_tree_off_tree
     of molecule_tag_formula

3. not databases but formulas

4. symbol_formula and designator_formula and path_formula

   designator is (symbol, state)
   does a molecule_symbol_formula exist ?
  
   Yes.

5. atom state
   - protonation
   - connection state
      -- bonding valence 
      -- linking tie 
         c_ <=> (C, valence = 3, tie = 3) : potentiality linked to extended-symbol
         actual state is (C, valence = 0, tie = 0) : designator


    bond : state -> state

   block state 
   - protonation --> implies --> atomic protonation
   - connection potentiality --> implies --> atomic connection

6. Molecule formula should be expressed as a CLOSED tree.
   i.e. a tree with a head_fragment as top
               with tail_fragments as leaves.
   ( a bridge is always a tail_fragment ) 

7. in category_formula 
   val map : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a category -> 'b category 

8. Naming

   In formulas instead of rn use ()n

   ChChr4 => Ch(Ch)4 

   {tree}
   [list of trees]
   (n Blocks repetition)n 

9. Aminoacid starts with OhCo ends with ChNh2 ( or ChNh in Proline) 

10. Fully symmetrical structures have to be defined by specific operators :
    Ex. :  cch_cy6  => benzene
           c_h_thd  => tetrahedrane 
   postfixed or prefixed ?

11. create polymer_molecule_symbol_formula_t.ml like symmetric_molecule_symbol_formula
*** done ***


12. residue -> peptideca (gly (embedded, nterminal), pro (embedded, nterminal), regular (embedded, nterminal)) 

13. Capped_leafed_tree replace list by tuple to speciy in type the number and kind of sons.

 a bifork block -> bifork fragment -> two sons in tree of specific type.
* cap is very specific.
* a son is always a grouping.

molecule formula = cap * grouping_formula 

grouping formula = 
| fragment * grouping_forwards * grouping_sidewards
| fragment * grouping_forwards * grouping_leftwards * grouping_rightwards


Purpose : to type chilarity by associating the position in tuple to that in space.

 
14. Peptide group  Ccoc Nch_

15. Build segments by extension of Blocks.

16. Build fragments from segments.

17. Isolate database from code. 
    polypeptide sequence
    block segment fragment grouping formula lowest level 

18. instead of a tree of marker
    tree of symbol
    instead of node list for sons (the list lose relative position)
       Fork of one, two, three, four son in a well defined relative position

    | Forth of  
    | Left of , Right of, Left of Right of ... North, West, East ...
