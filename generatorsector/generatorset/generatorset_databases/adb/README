The purpose of this directory is to store code to read the data necessary to build any Target of the Generatorset Domain.

The data are here Entityname.
They are organized in a file corresponding to one domain as a protein file in the PDB database.

Example :
   chemicalset_constructors_symbol.set
   geometryset_constructors_symbol.set
   geometryset_constructors_formula.set

entryadb : Here an entry is the doublet (domainset, symbols) 
           or (domainset, formulas)
           It corresponds to Pdb_ID and defines a database file.

keyabd   : the name of an entity, which defines it uniquely  

the trail associated list is used to define domainset category entity context
when necessary.
