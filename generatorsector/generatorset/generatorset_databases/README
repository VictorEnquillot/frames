= The Data world =

Four Camltypes need to be defined by the User : 
     
  Symbol Formula Value and Property

  Tag and Path are derived automatically from the Symbols.


== Data : Symbol ==

  This concerns only Symbols, that is to say Essential Camltypes.

  The User stores the information in File : 

  domainset_tags/outils/domainset_symbols_constructor.set

  frames/geometryset/geometryset_tags/outils/geometryset_symbols_constructor.set

  One line for each entity, like this :

  entity-name :<status>: entity-name entity-name ... entity-name 
  
 <status> is Uncontrained|Constrained  (private type)
	
  an entity-name appearing at the left of ":" is a Camltype
  an entity-name appearing at the right of ":" is a Constructor
  an entity-name being a Camltype is a Unary Constructor  ( | O of o )
  an entity-name not being a Camltype is a Nullary Constructor ( | N )

Remark :
  The Entity Domainset is not a Constructor 
  Some entities are only Constructors and never Camltypes 
 
  Camltypes and Constructors are defined from the same Entity-name
  with different syntaxic positions :

  a Camltype is found after "type"
  a Constructor is found after "|"


== Data : Formula ==

  This concerns only Formulas, that is to say Container Camltypes.

  The User stores the information in File : 
  domainset_formulas/outils/domainset_formulas_constructor.set
  
  One line for each entity, like this :
  entity-name :<status>: [constructor-name] datastructure entity-name entity-name ... entity-name [constructor-name] datastructure entity-name entity-name ... entity-name 
  
  all entity-name are Camltypes
  constructor-name is empty for Monoconstructor and an abritrary 
  fictive Entity name for Polyconstructors
