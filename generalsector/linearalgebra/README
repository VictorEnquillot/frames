This directory contains modules for generic entities. 
It is a kind of library.
There is no Path : these entities are not being managed by IRP.

As far as concern Quantum Mechanics Operator Matrices these are IRP managed entities with a Path. So are the MOs etc... even if they have a nature of vector or matrix.

A point is also without IRP it is part of Affine space 

Quaternions need to be implemented.

Vector must be redefined not using Array module.
